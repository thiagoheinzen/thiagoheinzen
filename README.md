<h1>Hello! Welcome to my profile. 🙋‍♂️</h1><br />
My name is <strong>Thiago Heinzen</strong>.
<br /> I'm 33 years old and I live in the South of Brazil. I am a Bachelor of Social Sciences from the Federal University of Santa Catarina.
<br />In 2023, I decided to pursue a new career, away from my initial field of study. That's when I started studying front-end development, an area that has always sparked my curiosity.
<br /><br />Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development at Cesumar University - Unicesumar. Additionally, I have been supplementing my studies through online courses, focusing on programming languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in UX and UI Design.

<br />I am seeking experience in the field of front-end development. I want to learn and be able to contribute to my team.
